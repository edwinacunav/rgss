## My Collection of RGSS 1 2 3 Scripts

I have published, under my nickname Kyonides Arkanthes, several scripts that may work in the RPG Maker engine series and decided it would be fine to upload some of them to my GitHub account.

Some of them might ask you to create TXT files and probably place them in a specific directory. Since I am not providing any so called templates for parsing, I would like to suggest you to visit https://save-point.org to find out more about those scripts that need some extra work to configure them.
